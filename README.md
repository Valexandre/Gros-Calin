Generateur de titres
===================
Title generator

A French python program to generate titles from a keyword.

Separate files are found in this repo: the *.py and 4 *.txt. In each of these, there is a list of expressions between " " and separated by a comma. 
Th program will browse each of these and see if the keyword typed into the *.py share some properties with one or several words of each expression.
Three tests are implemented: 
- does the keyword share its first 4 letters with a word inside the expression ?
- does the keyword share its last 4 letters with a word inside the expression ?
- does the keyword share 75% of its letters with a word inside the expression ?
